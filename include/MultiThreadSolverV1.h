/* we parallelize the isSafe() method using separate threads for row, column, and 3Ã—3 box checks. Here's how weâ€™ll approach it:
ðŸ”§ Key Changes in MultiThreadSolver (Version 1):
Spawn three threads:
One to check if the number is safe in the row.
One to check if the number is safe in the column.
One to check if the number is safe in the 3x3 box.
Combine their results to decide if a number is safe. */
